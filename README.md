Indiegogo
=========
Challenge for Indiegogo

Web-application has been deployed using Heroku to https://codylieu-indiegogochallenge.herokuapp.com/

Most of the relevant code for this challenge can be found in /app/scripts and /app/views

31 Karma/Jasmine unit tests can be found in /test/spec/controllers/campaigns.js, which I run using grunt test

Implemented using AngularJS/JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Yeoman

Features:
- Can search through campaigns by title or tagline or filter by category, percent funded, and funding type
- Clicking campaign will link to corresponding Indiegogo campaign page
- Percent funded bar uses Indiegogo color and shows percentage of funds collected compared to the goal
- Shows how many days left until funding campaign is over
